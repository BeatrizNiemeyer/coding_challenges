# therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

# EXAMPLES
# Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
# Output: "Sao Paulo"
# Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city.
# Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
